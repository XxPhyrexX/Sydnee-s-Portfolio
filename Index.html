        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Syndee McMullen, a 19 year old soon 
            to be Software Guild student with a passion for tech. I'm
        passionate also about philosophy and art which I implement into
        my everyday life along with my computer.</p>
        <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
        <p>Before I decided to attend the Software Guild, I was a
            college student working on classes towards a CS degree.
            I've taken one class that introduced me to Java. It was
            challeging in a good way that allowed me to expand my
            knowledge on a subject I woudl later find useful, I believe,
            in my career.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love 3d design, animation, and watching youtube videos
            about things tht interest or intrigue me! Finding new music, and
        art on the internet is another hobby of mine I find to be very
        cool since there's so much to explore.</p>
